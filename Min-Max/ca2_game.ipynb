    "For this computer assignment , we use minimax algorithm to implement checkers game. <br>\n",
    "In this game we each team has 12 pieces and each piece <br>\n",
    "can move diagonal , based on her color and type (king or normal).<br>\n",
    "To simply explain minimax algorithm , each player tries <br>\n",
    "to do the best move based on next move of opponent <br>\n",
    "(assuming that opponent will do the optimal move) and again <br>\n",
    "his opponent do the same tries it till we reach our depth , <br>\n",
    "and we can say that depth shows how many <br>\n",
    "levels does player predict and then chooses his move, <br>\n",
    "so more depth gives the player better choices and a better prediction <br>\n",
    ", but we should now that our nodes expand exponentially , <br>\n",

    "<br>\n",
    "Evaluation : The amount we choose to describe how is the situation for each player .<br>\n",
    "             In this project our evaluation function returns whiteLeft - redLeft + (whiteKings * 0.5 - redKings * 0.5).<br>\n",
    "             The more this amount is , the better is the situation whiteplayer has and vice versa .<br>\n",
    "             So the whiteplayer tries to maximise it while red player tries to minimise itby his moves.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Using depth 1 for both teams, the game will <br>\n",
    "et to ends very soon cause we don't need much time to predict it , and the winner is red player<br>\n",
    "cuase he starts first . and our root will first lead to it.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Using depth 5 and 2 , we will need more time to make<br>\n",
    "a move cause of the explaind reasons , and the team using depth 5 will win<br>\n",
    "cause he will predict the game more accurate <br>\n",
    "and tries to have a better situation in 5 turns not only in 2 turns.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Using depth 5 for both teams , red team wins again because he starts first , just same to using depth 5 and 5 .<br>\n"
